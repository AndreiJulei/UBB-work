What code to write for Flights problem
    - Flight class with properties (only those needed)
    - FlightRepository (text-file based directly, no inheritance)
    - FlightService
    - UserInterface class (implement 1 functionality at a time)
        - Print all flights when starting the program
    - PyUnit test for add flight functionality
        -> class TestAddFlight(TestCase):
                ...

        -> specification in Service/Repository classes for addFlight function
            what is a function specification??
                - what the function does (in human terms) -> NOT how the function does it
                - input parameters
                - what it returns (in all cases, so None included)
                - any exceptions raised?

The attached code is a student solution for the problem requirements
