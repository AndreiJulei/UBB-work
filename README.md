This repository contains most of my assignments and tests from my studies at UBB in Cluj-Napoca. Unfortunately some of the files have been lost in the process.

What I've studied in the first year:
    First semester: Computer Systems Architecture, Fundamentals of Programming, Algebra, Computational Logic, Analysis
    Second semester: Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Geometry, Dynamical Systems, Graphs Algorithms
